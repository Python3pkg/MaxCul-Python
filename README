# About MaxCul for Python

This Module is forked from this Project https://github.com/jokey2k/MoritzServer.
It can communicate over a serial connection and a cul stick with MAX! Devices build by eQ-3 http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/max.html.

The CUL (or CC1101 USB Lite) is a USB Stick, which sends and receive Packages in the 868Mhz frequenz. The FHEM Community delevoped a open Firmeware for the Stick and so the MAX! Protocoll ist only one of many Protocolls you can use with this Stick.
I build my own Stick with this Instruction: https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/Selbstbau_CUL
But you can buy it for example here: http://www.busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CUL

This Module interprets the serial commands from the CUL and can encode Commands to send them to the CUL.


When I bought some thermostats to implement a first step in smart home, there were only the options to either use a proprietary remote-controlled LAN-Gateway called MAX!Cube or use FHEM which is both complex and not simple to setup on a NAS.

So a smaller version around a CUL like FHEM supports was implemented from scratch. Idea is to just do data-keeping and leaving the interface part to some other place. Think of it as a gateway device you control yourself.

Prerequisites are a CUL USB stick and a recent CULFW (1.61 or newer) on it.

Connection with this command trough tunnel.
